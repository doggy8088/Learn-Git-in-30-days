# Day 15: Tags - Marking Important Events in Version Control

In the process of software development, we often need to mark certain important milestones in the project, such as release versions (v1.0, v2.0, etc.). Git provides the tag feature for this purpose.

## Understanding Tags

A tag is a reference that points to a specific commit in your Git history. Unlike branches, tags don't move when you make new commits - they always point to the same commit. This makes tags ideal for marking release points or other significant milestones.

Git supports two types of tags:

1. **Lightweight tags**: Simply a name for a specific commit
2. **Annotated tags**: Stored as full objects with additional metadata

## Creating Lightweight Tags

The simplest way to create a tag:

```
git tag v1.0
```

This creates a lightweight tag named `v1.0` pointing to the current commit (HEAD).

To tag a specific commit:

```
git tag v0.9 <commit-hash>
```

## Creating Annotated Tags

Annotated tags are recommended for most use cases because they store extra information:

```
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"
```

The `-a` flag creates an annotated tag, and `-m` specifies the tag message.

## Listing Tags

To see all tags in your repository:

```
git tag
```

To see tags matching a pattern:

```
git tag -l "v1.*"
```

## Viewing Tag Information

For a lightweight tag:

```
git show v1.0
```

This shows the commit the tag points to.

For an annotated tag:

```
git show v1.0
```

This shows the tag information plus the commit details.

## Tagging Old Commits

You can tag commits that are not at HEAD:

```
git log --oneline  # Find the commit hash
git tag -a v0.5 -m "Beta release" <commit-hash>
```

## Pushing Tags to Remote

By default, `git push` doesn't transfer tags. You need to explicitly push them:

```
# Push a specific tag
git push origin v1.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

## Deleting Tags

To delete a local tag:

```
git tag -d v1.0
```

To delete a remote tag:

```
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0
# or
git push origin --delete v1.0
```

## Checking Out Tags

You can check out the code at a specific tag:

```
git checkout v1.0
```

This puts you in a "detached HEAD" state. If you want to make changes, create a new branch:

```
git checkout -b version-1-fixes v1.0
```

## Today's Summary

Tags are an essential part of version control, allowing you to mark important points in your project's history. Annotated tags are particularly useful for releases as they can store additional information like release notes, tagger information, and signatures.

Let me reorganize the Git commands and parameters learned today:

* git tag
* git tag -a
* git tag -l
* git show
* git push origin --tags
* git tag -d
* git checkout
